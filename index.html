        <h2>Favorite CPSC 120L Labs</h2>

            <h3 class="card-title">Lab 1</h3>
            <p class="card-text">In my first lab for CPSC120L, I tackled the classic "Hello World!" project, where I programmed a C++ application to print a customized greeting. This initial exercise was an introduction to basic programming syntax but also made the process engaging by personalizing the output to my classmates. It was an exciting first step into the world of coding, setting the stage for more complex projects.</p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Lab 9</h3>
            <p class="card-text">In Lab 9, parts 1 and 2, the challenges and complexities of my coursework escalated significantly. We developed functions to read words from a file and compare them against a dictionary to identify misspellings. This task sharpened my programming skills and introduced me to practical applications of data handling and text processing in C++. The lab was an engaging and intricate exploration of handling real-world data issues through coding.</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">Lab 11</h3>
                <p class="card-text">In Lab 11, part 1, the task involved enhancing functionality and organization of the code by integrating separate functions into a cohesive structure. The lab introduces a method, ReadCSV, which reads data from a CSV file into a structured format, using vectors of strings to manage the rows and cells efficiently. Additionally, it showcases the implementation of a State class, which encapsulates properties such as name, population, and land area, and includes methods to access these properties and calculate population density. This approach emphasizes cleaner and more modular programming practices.</p>
